This program uses the Disjoint set Data structure to generate the maze specifically it uses a disjoint set Forest.
If there is no wall between 2 "rooms" (aka nodes) then one node is the child of the other or rather the 
Nodes in the forest are connected.

The output for this program isnt really usable beacause I have not made a print() function which prints a visual representation
of the maze instead it just prints all the nodes and all the children of said nodes from this one can fairly easily draw the maze

As it is it's really just an excersize but it could be adapted to other things quite easily
