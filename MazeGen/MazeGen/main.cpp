	The only thing that does not work is th Maze.build() for some reason it always culminates in an infinite loop
	the next stage of testing would be to manually build a maze and check that all required functions work however the TESTS area
	below already prooves that they do 
	If the solution comes in a timely manner the code will be reuploaded as of now though, while the union-find data structure(disjoint set),
	which is the unerling lesson in this programming assignment, works the overall goal of generating a full maze does not.
