//|    the findN() and  merge() operations for the Parent Pointer Tree Data struc.							 |
//|	   and by extension the same methods in the DJSet class have amortized runnning cost					 |
//|    equal to some constant which is the inverse of the Ackerman function                                  |
//|    (see  Wikipedia:  Disjoint Set Data Structure)														 |
//|    Thus each subsequent operation on the tree is done faster.											 |
//|    However du to the actual creatioon of the Maze in the Maze class this might not seem super apperant   |

	 This allows us decrease the depth of the tree at the same time increaseing the width making later traversals faster

	  It also adds the PARENT TREE's CHILDREN PPTrees to an array to make later look up easy 
	  ONLY IF BOTH RANKS ARE SAME does the code INCREASE rank

	0
	  Note that you cant really have loopy trees due to the fact that union(x,y) and union(y,x) are the same operation because of the way find() works
		 For example:
	0
	
	  Let's say I have    3 Parent is 5   &&  1 Parent is 3  what I really have is:   3 Parent is 5   &&   1 Parent is 5
	  so lets say I make a new set (6):     6 Parent is 6   because it is a singleton
		now I want to unite/merge   6 & 1  i.e  unite(6,1)   well that mean that by the end of it I will have:   3 Parent is 5   &&   1 Parent is 5  &&   6 Parent is 5
		therefore doing the operation:   unite(1,6)  to form a loop is pointless  since both 1 and 6 already have the same parent
